Let's get started with _**WSO2 Micro Integrator**_ by running a simple use case on this environment. 
In this example, we use a REST API to simulate a simple HTTP service (HelloWorld service) deployed in an instance of WSO2 Micro Integrator. 
You can deploy this **HelloWorld service** on a **Docker container** or on **Kubernetes**. When invoked, the HelloWorld service will return the following response: _{"Hello":"World"}_
